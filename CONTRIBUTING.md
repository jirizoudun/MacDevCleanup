## ‚ûï How to Add a New Cleanup Section

To add a new cleanup section:

1. **Define a new section** in the config file (e.g. `my_custom_cleanup`):

```json
"my_custom_cleanup": [
  {
    "path": "~/Library/Caches/MyTool",
    "description": "MyTool Cache",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

2. **Update `mac-dev-cleanup.sh`**:

   - Add a new function for your cleanup section following the existing pattern
   - Implement proper safety checks using `is_safe_path`
   - Add size reporting using `print_size`
   - Include interactive confirmation using `confirm`
   - Add the new function call to the main cleanup sequence
   - Use the existing color-coded logging system

3. **Test** the section with both the default and custom config files.

4. **Update the README** with a brief description if it's a widely-used tool.

## ‚úÖ Code Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style (functions, spacing, naming)
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Always guard against deleting important directories
- Use the provided utility functions for logging and safety checks
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
  - descriptive names for clarity
