- PascalCase for class names.
- snake_case for file names and directory structures.

### Bash Scripting

- Use descriptive names for scripts and variables (e.g., `backup_files.sh` or `log_rotation`).
- Write modular scripts with functions to enhance readability and reuse.
- Include comments for each major section or function.
- Validate all inputs using `getopts` or manual validation logic.
- Avoid hardcoding; use environment variables or parameterized inputs.
- Ensure portability by using POSIX-compliant syntax.
- Use `shellcheck` to lint scripts and improve quality.
- Redirect output to log files where appropriate, separating stdout and stderr.
- Use `trap` for error handling and cleaning up temporary files.
